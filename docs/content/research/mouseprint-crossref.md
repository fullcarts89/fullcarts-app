# Mouseprint × FullCarts DB — cross-reference

**Companion to:** `mouseprint-downsizing-census.md`
**Run:** 2026-06-15 · **DB as-of:** 2,227 events / 937 brands / 1,880 products
**Method:** For each mouseprint case with numeric old→new sizes, an automated SQL match against
`published_changes` (non-retracted) on **brand-prefix + size-pair within ±3%/±0.25 tolerance**, best
match by `evidence_count`. Results then hand-verified — the tolerance produced a few **false positives**
where a *different* product of the same brand fell inside the numeric window (corrected below).

**Scope note:** Our corpus is **2020→present** (only 13 events predate 2020). Mouseprint's pre-2020
archive (~70 cases, Häagen-Dazs 14oz pint, Tropicana 64→59, Tide 87→70, Breyer's/Edy's 56→48, etc.)
is therefore **out of corpus by construction** — listed in the census as historical/evergreen content
fodder, not cross-referenced here. This file covers the **2020–2026** overlap window.

**Type note:** Skimpflation / dilution / reformulation cases (no clean size pair) can't be size-matched
and are listed separately at the bottom as their own claim-candidate set.

## Headline

- **~95** mouseprint numeric cases checked in the 2020–2026 window.
- **~48 already TRACKED** in our DB (often with deep evidence — Folgers 31, Gatorade 28, Kleenex 20,
  Cottonelle 15, Tropicana 12, Charmin 11, Gain 9, Aleve 8, Angel Soft 5). Our Reddit/news/GDELT
  scrapers independently catch the high-virality shrinks — including the same recent ones mouseprint
  just published (Febreze 8.8→8.1, Smucker's, Thomas', Quilted Northern, Tide 84→80, Ziploc, Cascade,
  Dole, Kroger, SeaPak, Little Debbie, Tyson, Q-Tips, Jif, Lorna Doone, Mission, Tom's of Maine…).
- **~47 GAPs** — documented by mouseprint, not in our DB. These are the **claim-creation candidates**
  (pending the go/no-go discussion). Listed below, newest first.

> **The standout convergence (already tracked):** **Febreze Air Mist 8.8→8.1 fl oz** — mouseprint
> published it 2026-06-08; our DB logged the identical change **2026-04-07** (3 evidence), ~2 months
> earlier. Strongest "two independent watchdogs, we had it first" content beat in the set.

## GAPS — mouseprint documents it, we don't (claim candidates)

Newest first. `~%` = computed cut. These need their own evidence before any DB write (see "Claim
creation" note at bottom). A ⚠ marks a near-miss where we track a *different* size/product of the
same brand (so it's a genuinely new event, not a dupe).

## Skimpflation / non-size candidates (separate claim track)

These are recipe/dilution/quality cuts (no clean size pair) — candidates for the **evidence-wall /
Skimpflation channel**, not size events. Verify independently before any write.

- **Reese's** — milk chocolate → composite, peanut butter → "creme" (2026-02) — *flagship; high interest*
- **Turkey Hill** ice cream → "frozen dairy dessert" (2025-07)
- **Blue Bunny** ice cream → "frozen dairy dessert" (2024-02)
- **Annie's** Shells & Cheddar reformulation (2025-04)
- **Imperial** margarine — oil 53%→48%, 70→60 cal (2025-03)
- **Smart Balance** spread — fat 64%→39% (2022–2023)
- **Wish-Bone** Italian — oil −22%, +water, +salt (2023-08)
- **Aldi** margarine — oil 51%→40% (2018, evergreen)
- **CVS / Kroger / Walgreens / Robitussin** cough syrup — concentration cut ~50% (2022-12)
- **Act** mouthwash — fluoride 0.05%→0.02% (2022-12)
- **Hungry Man** Double Chicken Bowls — protein 39→33 g (2022-10)
- **Lysol** Disinfecting Wipes — thinner substrate, 19.7→17.7 oz (2018, evergreen)

## SEEDED 2026-06-15 — 49 pending claims written

The 2024–2026 numeric gaps (49 cases) were seeded as **pending claims** per the go-ahead, each with a
`raw_items` anchor. They ride the normal approve → promote pipeline but **still need real FullCarts
evidence to survive review** — mouseprint is a lead, not a citable source. Tagging for identification:

- `claims.extractor_version = 'mouseprint-census-v1'` · `status='pending'` · `confidence={"overall":0.5,"origin":"mouseprint_census"}`
- `raw_items.source_type='community_tip'` (allowlist-constrained) · `scraper_version='mouseprint-census-v1'` · `raw_payload->>'origin'='mouseprint_census'`

These appear in `/admin/claims` under the pending queue (Community badge). The 2020–2023 gaps were
**not** seeded (held back as lower-priority). The 12 skimpflation candidates were **not** seeded
(no clean size pair).

**One-line full reversal** (if you want them gone):
```sql
DELETE FROM claims WHERE extractor_version='mouseprint-census-v1';
DELETE FROM raw_items WHERE scraper_version='mouseprint-census-v1';
```

## Claim creation — how (pending go-ahead)

If we green-light creating claims for the gaps, the clean path (no schema change) is the same one the
public `/submit` form uses: write a `raw_items` anchor (`source_type='community_tip'` or a new
`source_type='mouseprint_ref'`) + a `pending` `claims` row per case, then they ride the normal
approve → promote pipeline. **But** every claim still needs *our own* evidence to survive review —
mouseprint is a lead, not a source we can cite. Realistic options to discuss:
1. **Seed pending claims** from the gaps (brand/size/%) and let the existing scrapers/vision backfill
   evidence — lowest effort, but claims sit unverified until real evidence lands.
2. **Targeted re-scrape** — point the Kroger/Walmart/OFF/Open-Prices scrapers + Wayback at the specific
   gap SKUs to capture real before/after listings as first-class evidence, then create claims that are
   already substantiated. Higher effort, but produces publishable events.
3. **Cherry-pick** the ~12 highest-magnitude / most on-trend gaps (Froot Loops 21.8%, Dove Dark 24%,
   Trader Joe's 20%, Crystal Light 33%, Post Premier 18%, All 17%, Hershey Dark 17.6%, Kirkland
   Softener 19.8%, Finish 18.4%, Scotts 20%) for manual evidence-backed entry + content.

**Recommendation:** option 2 or 3, not 1 — seeding bare unverified claims pollutes the review queue
and risks the data-quality flags. Decide scope before any DB write.
